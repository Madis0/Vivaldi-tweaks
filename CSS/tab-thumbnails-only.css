  Make sure the setting "Thumbnails on tabs" is enabled before using this style.

  Also be aware that the close buttons will disappear and active tab has very light
  indication (colored lines on left and right edge).

  You can change the height of the tab/thumbnail by dragging on the bottom edge of
  the tab bar.
